2.
    a) Why do modern computers typically organize physical memory into words?
        Byte addressing would require more addresses, because each byte must be assigned an address 
        and if it were byte addressed it must support byte transfer, which has worse performance than
        a larger word transfer.

    b) Why is the programmerâ€™s view of memory usually byte addressable?
        Byte addressable memory allows programmer's to easily access small data items such as characters.
    c) What can programmers do in their source code to improve memory performance
        Aligning data on boundaries that correspond to physical word size can improve program performance.
